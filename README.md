# Project: Orchestra Concert/Rehearsal Scheduler

This project is a Flutter application designed to help orchestras manage their concerts in a more organized way. The application allows users to create concerts, add repertoire, select musicians and sections, and organize the music stands for the invited musicians. The application is divided into different forms to facilitate the collection of relevant information.

## Features

- **Concert Creation**: Users can create concerts and provide detailed information, such as the concert title, repertoire, invited sections, and the concert date.
- **Repertoire**: Users can add pieces to the concert repertoire using a text input field, with a button to dynamically add pieces.
- **Musician Management**: Users can select musicians for each section, managing music stands by instrument and allowing up to two musicians per stand.
- **Multi-Step Form**: The concert creation process is divided into two forms to simplify data entry.
